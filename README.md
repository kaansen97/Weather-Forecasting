# Prediction Model for Precipitation Level and Snowfall

This README presents a prediction model for estimating the precipitation level and snowfall based on provided features. The following tasks were performed:

## Data Exploration

The data was explored by calculating standard descriptive statistics, visualizing the variables with different graphs, and drawing distributions and histograms of variables. Outliers were also detected and interesting observations were made. Correlations were also investigated.

## Data Pre-processing

The data was pre-processed by handling and filling unknowns if there were any.

## Model Building

A prediction model was built using the training data to estimate the precipitation level and snowfall.

## Model Evaluation

The accuracy of the model was evaluated and compared using the test data.

All these tasks were performed using the two provided Google Colab notebooks:


- Prepare_data.ipynb
- Data_analytics_Training_.ipynb

Please refer to these notebooks for more information about the tasks performed and the results obtained.
